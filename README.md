# Scraping

This is a project concerning the scraping of Carid.com. 
I have made a .exe file that you can run and that can do the scraping and put the results in an excel spreadsheet automatically.

HOW TO RUN :

FIRST : You need to have the 104 version of chrome. Which of today (14/07/2022) is the beta version of chrome, so you HAVE TO install the beta version of chrome.

SECOND : Once you download my project, you need to add the chromedriver to your PATH variable.

THIRD : Go to the dist folder and run the .exe file, it will run just fine.
